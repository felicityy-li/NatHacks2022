The biggest barrier to crisis response is feeling helpless even if you open up and say something it's not going to do anything. The person on the other side might not say anything and actually, help you because they donâ€™t understand you. If an individual is under stress, it is harder to communicate with words. However, if we have brain wave data that indicates stress, we can have healthcare professionals make a prognosis or diagnosis early on and this could be done using the muse to check for elevated stress.



## What does our project do?
NeuroJournal has been working on an AI chatbot to detect stress while collecting patient brainwaves. So even when they are not talking, we have a nonverbal way of telling the waveform that is associated with stress and can further Incorporate clinician or therapist expertise. The individual would journal a stressful event and natural language processing would be used to detect the words and assign them a rating score.
