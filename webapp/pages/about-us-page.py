st.markdown("We are a group of students and graduates who are attempting to create a journaling web app that can detect stress on a quantitative and qualitative level that clinicians as well as therapists can implement. We thought as individuals in academia who are subjected to the dread of stress, this would be an excellent tool to implement on a wider scale and improve care for those under distress.")

st.markdown("This tool uses a combination of EEG data as well as Natural Language Processing (NLP) to not only biologically quantify points of stress, but also look at key words and phrases on a qualitative level. This can assist in therapy and other applications pertaining to stressful situations.")
